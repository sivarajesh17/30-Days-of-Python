# 🐍 30 Days of Python

Welcome to my **30 Days of Python** journey! 🚀

I have started learning Python programming with a strong commitment to practice daily and document my progress here. This repository will be my **learning log**, **coding playground**, and **portfolio** of Python exercises and projects.

The content I follow is inspired by the excellent open-source learning material created by **Asabeneh Yetayeh**. His roadmap provides a structured, hands-on way to learn Python from the absolute basics to advanced concepts.

## 🎯 Goal of this Repository

- Build a strong foundation in Python programming  
- Practice daily exercises to reinforce concepts  
- Share my progress openly through GitHub  
- Develop consistency and coding discipline over these 30 days

## 📅 My Learning Plan

- Each day I will pick a topic from the **30 Days of Python** curriculum  
- Solve the exercises and upload my solutions as Python scripts  
- Document important notes, examples, and takeaways  

### By the end of 30 days, I aim to have:

- A solid Python knowledge base  
- A collection of clean, well-documented scripts  
- Confidence to use Python in projects, automation, and real-world applications
